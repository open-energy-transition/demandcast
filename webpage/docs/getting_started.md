# Extended Getting Started Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to setting up and using DemandCast. It covers installation, configuration, basic usage, and answers to frequently asked questions.

## Installation and Setup

To install DemandCast, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-energy-transition/demandcast.git
cd demandcast
```

### 2. Set up your environment

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as a package manager to install the required dependencies and create an environment stored in `.venv`.

`uv` can be used within the provided Dockerfile or installed standalone (see [installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).

The `ETL` folder and each subfolder in the `models` directory—each representing a separate model—contain their own `pyproject.toml` files that define the dependencies for that module.

To set up the environment, run:
```bash
cd ETL # or cd models/model_name
uv sync
```

Alternatively, you may use a package manager of your choice (e.g., `conda`) to install the dependencies listed in the respective `pyproject.toml`. If you choose this approach, please adjust the commands below to align with the conventions of your selected package manager.

### 3. Configure environment variables

Some modules require API keys to access data from external services. These keys should be stored in a `.env` file in the `ETL/` directory. The `.env` file should not be included in the repository and should contain the following environment variables:

```plaintext
CDS_API_KEY=<your_key>             # For data retrieval from Copernicus CDS
ENTSOE_API_KEY=<your_key>          # For data retrieval from ENTSO-E
EIA_API_KEY=<your_key>             # For data retrieval from EIA
ZENODO_API_KEY=<your_key>          # For data upload to Zenodo
SANDBOX_ZENODO_API_KEY=<your_key>  # For data upload to Zenodo Sandbox
```

Replace `<your_key>` with your actual API keys. You can obtain these keys by registering on the respective service websites.
