# XGBoost

From [XGBoost documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):

`XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable.
It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.`

## Motivation

The core motivation for using XGBoost to generate hourly electricity demand forecasts is due to previous work in literature.
In addition, since its a fast model to train and run inference,
it serves as a great option for a baseline that can be expanded on in future work.
Some of those future models will be featured here.
